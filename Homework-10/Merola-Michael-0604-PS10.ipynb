    "(15 pts total) A matching in a graph $G$ is a subset $E_M \\subseteq E(G)$ of edges such that each vertex touches at most one of the edges in $E_M$. Recall that a bipartite graph is a graph $G$ on two sets of vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$, such that every edge has one endpoint in $V_1$ and one endpoint in $V_2$. We sometimes write $G = (V_1, V_2; E)$ for this situation. For example:\n",

Thus, if they are able to place a member of the Order at every intersection of hallways, they'll be able to monitor all hallways. In order not to spare any personnel, they want to place as few people as possible at intersections, while still being able to monitor every hallway.
