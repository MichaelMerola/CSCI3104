    "(15 pts total) A matching in a graph $G$ is a subset $E_M \\subseteq E(G)$ of edges such that each vertex touches at most one of the edges in $E_M$. Recall that a bipartite graph is a graph $G$ on two sets of vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$, such that every edge has one endpoint in $V_1$ and one endpoint in $V_2$. We sometimes write $G = (V_1, V_2; E)$ for this situation. For example:\n",

Once a vertex has been paired, it **cannot** be connected to any other vertex by an edge from $E_m$. For two sets of vertices [$V_1, V_2$], there can't be any other edges added to $E_m$ once the smaller set of vertices have been completely matched because a vertex from the smaller set would then have more than one edge.

The algo would also assign directions to the graph. In this case, the direction of the edges will all be towards $t$.\n",
